# Counter Project to Learn Hooks

This project is a simple React application created to understand why we use hooks and how to use the `useState` hook in functional components.

## Introduction

React hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. The `useState` hook is a fundamental hook that lets you add state to your functional components. This project demonstrates a basic use case of the `useState` hook by implementing a simple counter.

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `App.jsx`: The main component where the counter logic is implemented.
  - `App.css`: The CSS file for styling the component.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
